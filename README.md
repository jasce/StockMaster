# StockMaster

StockMaster is a real‐time stock watchlist monitoring and management application.The Yahoo Finance API (application programming interface) will be
utilized to fetch real‐time stock quote information from within the client. The application will not
include a dynamic back end, so all information will be fetched from the Yahoo Finance API directly
or, in the case of company ticker symbols, be contained within a static JSON (JavaScript Object
Notation) file.
